DVBCUT INSTALL -- last edited 2012-09-19

In order to compile dvbcut, you need to have the following libraries
installed:

* Qt, version 4
* ffmpeg (optional, for video encoding and decoding)
* libao (optional, for sound output)
* libmad and liba52 for MP2 and AC3 decoding, respectively.

If you have MPlayer installed on your machine (and it is accessible as
"mplayer"), you can play the videos inside DVBCUT.

How to compile DVBCUT:

* Unpack the dvbcut source archive and enter the dvbcut directory.
* Type `qmake && make'. If everything works well, you will find
  the DVBCUT executable in the bin subdirectory. To install it, run
  `make install' (as root).
